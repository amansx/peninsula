					<h4>COMMERCIAL CARPET CLEANING</h4>
					<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
					<b>Do I need to vaccum before service?</b>
					<p>
A light vacuuming in the areas to be cleaned is recommended but is not required. Our crew will pre-vacuum the areas to be cleaned as 70% of carpet soil is dry soil.
					</p>
					<b>How long does it take to get the job done?</b>
					<p>
On average, it will take approximately 20 minutes per area. This time can vary greatly, depending on the amount of furniture to be moved, how soiled the carpet is, and the necessity for stain removal.
					</p>
					<b>What do you mean by 'area'?</b>
					<p>
Typically, an area is a room that is 8 meters or less. Living room/dining room combos are considered two areas. Any area over 8 meters but less than 12 meters would incur a small additional charge. Areas greater than 12 meters would be priced as two areas. Non-standard areas (baths, steps, landings, walk-in closets, etc.) are priced separately from the standard areas, usually at a lesser price.</p>
					<b>Can you give me a quote over the phone?</b>
					<p>Yes, there is no need for us to visit your home. Commercial property may require a site visit.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<b>How many times a year, should I have my carpets cleaned?</b>
					<p>Carpet Manufacturers recommend cleaning carpets every six months. Cleaning frequency depends on a number of things such as the number of occupants in the household, pets, smokers, and children.
					</p>
					<b>Do you remove urine stains and pet odour?</b>
					<p>
Our expert cleaning crew ensures that the deodoriser in our cleaning solution will deal with most pet odours. We guarantee that you will remove all urine stains. 
					</p>
					<b>What should I do about the furniture in the room?</b>
					<p>
Our cleaners will happily move any furniture that does not require more than one person. We ask you to remove small objects and breakables before the cleaner arrives.</p>
